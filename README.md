## nodedmx adapter for ioBroker

nodedmx adapter is used to have access to node-dmx/dmx modules for accessing various DMX devices as explained here: 

https://github.com/node-dmx/dmx

Actually this devices are supported:

    null: a development driver that prints the universe to stdout
    socketio: a driver which sends out the universe via socket.IO as an array (see demo_socket_client.js as a client example)
    artnet: driver for EnttecODE
    bbdmx: driver for BeagleBone-DMX
    dmx4all: driver for DMX4ALL devices like the "NanoDMX USB Interface"
    enttec-usb-dmx-pro: a driver for devices using a Enttec USB DMX Pro chip like the "DMXKing ultraDMX Micro".
    enttec-open-usb-dmx: driver for "Enttec Open DMX USB". This device is NOT recommended, there are known hardware limitations and this driver is not very stable. (If possible better obtain a device with the "pro" chip)
    dmxking-utra-dmx-pro: driver for the DMXKing Ultra DMX pro interface. This driver support multiple universe specify the options with Port = A or B

I have only tested the dmx4all device together with a nanoDMX Controler.

Parameters: 
Device = hardware device e.g.    /dev/ttyACM0     for nanoDMX
Driver = driver name as mentioned above,    dmx4all    in my case
Last DMX channel used = range of channels to be created as objects under IO Broker
F.e. 20 will create the objects nodedmx.0.DMX000 to nodedmx.0.DMX020 these objects can be accessed by IOBroler or Node Red etc...

The adapter is only supporting direct access to channels - no other features of class DMX-Animation of node-dmx are supported!
